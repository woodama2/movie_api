    <h1>MyFlix API v.1.0.0</h1>
    <p>
      Objective: To build the server-side component of a "movies" web
      application. The web application will provide users with access to
      information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be
      able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of
      their favorite movies.
    </p>
    <p>The MyFlix APIs are all built using RESTful architecture.</p>
    <p>
      Errors are returned as standard HTTP response codes. Messages detailing
      the error are included in the response body.
    </p>
